1. Auto generate a canvas with randomly generated colors (to remfamiliarise yourself with a number of concepts) -- complete
2. Build an off-canvas representation of the target image -- complete
3. Build a meta model of that image representing colors -- complete
4. Add a button that randomly selects the colours and amends the squares of the grid with those colours
5. Add an array that captures the new model generated 
6. Check the array for uniqueness (do this between each generation), remove any not unique
7. Have the button run a function that does all this stuff as many times as there are places in the array (set a max)
8. Capture a screenshot of each randomly generated visual model
9. Add these as a collection and mint them on an nft platform
10. See what happens (worst case scenario, it's just another a portfolio project)
